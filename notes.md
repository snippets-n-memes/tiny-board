- newTicketPrompt needs a helper function for redrawing the window
- the radioButton interface needs a rework
    - statuses are just written to the field
    - we need them to be selectable, possibly by being separate windows?
- editTicketPrompt needs to be implemented
    - could also leverage a helper function for drawing the window (same one as newTicketPrompt)
